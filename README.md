Turn and talk- share your idea with your partner- //1 min
Whole class share aloud-  3 min
Time: 5 min

Lesson Content: Discussion about the basic //characteristics of a triangle;
Different types of triangles;

How to use an if statement to prove that a shape //with 3 //sides is a triangle. 
Time: 10 minutes

Lesson Activity: 
Given 3 different shapes, test whether they form //triangles:
a-  Write code that tests the conditions for a //triangle;
 15 min
b- Volunteers share their work.
 10 min

Time: 25 min

Closing: Chat storm: one thing I can do well/or one thing I need help with.
Time: 1 minute

## Live Coding Experience

### This was done in Snap.
I was not able to copy the code here because the language is block based.

# Programming in Java
### The Mancala
##### This is one of the first projects that I completed. I completed this in a group with Chris and Peter. Our interaction was great, and I learned a lot from the two of them. Indeed, I could not have completed this project without their insightful contributions.

##### The project was completed on Replit.
